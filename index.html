<p>MY PETS!!</p>
    
I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.

    <p>Luna</p>

    Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.

    <p>Slowpoke</p>

    Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.

    <p>Hamster</p>
    <img src="Fish.jpg" alt="fish"
      width="150px" height="150px">
    Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.
